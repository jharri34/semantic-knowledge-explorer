# Semantic Knowledge Explorer: Next Steps

Congratulations! You've successfully set up the core components of your Semantic Knowledge Explorer. This document outlines how to use your current setup and provides a roadmap for future enhancements.

## How to Use the Script (`main.py`)

Your `main.py` script is designed to ingest PDF documents, generate conceptual embeddings, and perform semantic searches within your LanceDB knowledge base.

1.  **Update Your PDF Path:**
    *   Open `main.py` in your text editor.
    *   Locate the line `example_pdf_path = "/mnt/d/workspace/example.pdf"`.
    *   **Change this path** to the absolute path of any PDF file on your system that you wish to ingest. For example:
        ```python
        example_pdf_path = "/mnt/d/Documents/MyResearchPaper.pdf"
        ```
    *   Each time you run the script with a new PDF path, it will ingest that document's content into your LanceDB.

2.  **Customize Your Searches:**
    *   In `main.py`, you'll find example semantic search queries:
        ```python
        await semantic_search("What are the main themes of the book?", db_table)
        await semantic_search("Key concepts discussed in the text.", db_table)
        ```
    *   **Modify these lines** or add new `await semantic_search(...)` calls with your own questions, concepts, or passages you want to find similar content for.

3.  **Run the Script:**
    *   Open your terminal.
    *   Navigate to your project directory: `cd /mnt/d/workspace/SemanticKnowledgeExplorer`
    *   Execute the script: `python main.py`

4.  **Interpret the Results:**
    *   The script will print the most conceptually similar text chunks found in your LanceDB.
    *   You'll see:
        *   **Source:** The document name and chunk ID where the text was found.
        *   **Similarity:** A numerical score indicating how close the concept is (lower `_distance` means higher similarity).
        *   **Text:** The relevant text snippet from the document.

## Customizing Your Knowledge Base

*   **Ingest More Documents:** Simply change `example_pdf_path` in `main.py` to a new PDF and run the script again. The new document's embeddings will be added to your existing LanceDB table.
*   **Clear Knowledge Base:** If you want to start fresh, you can delete the `lancedb_data` directory within your project folder. This will remove all stored embeddings and data.
    ```bash
    rm -rf /mnt/d/workspace/SemanticKnowledgeExplorer/lancedb_data
    ```
    The next time you run `main.py`, a new, empty database will be created.

## Future Enhancements (Roadmap)

This project has a strong foundation, and here are some ideas for how you can expand its capabilities, aligning with the learning stages and knowledge synthesis goals:

### Phase 2: Refinement & Basic Conceptual Visualization

*   **Improved Text Chunking:**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure chunks are more semantically coherent and contextually rich.
    *   **Techniques:** Explore libraries like `langchain`'s text splitters (e.g., `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, `SentenceSplitter`) or custom logic that respects document structure (headings, paragraphs).
*   **Enhanced Metadata Extraction:**
    *   **Goal:** Store more useful information about each document.
    *   **Techniques:** Extract title, author, publication year from PDFs (if available) and store them alongside chunks in LanceDB. This will improve search result context.
*   **Basic Clustering & Grouping:**
    *   **Goal:** Identify groups of conceptually related chunks or documents.
    *   **Techniques:** Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, HDBSCAN from `scikit-learn`) to the embeddings. You could then print which chunks belong to which cluster, or identify central themes of clusters.
*   **Structured Output with Rich:**
    *   **Goal:** Make CLI output even more readable and informative, potentially showing relationships between search results.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & Interactive UI (Long-term Vision)

*   **Interactive Web User Interface:**
    *   **Goal:** Provide a visual and interactive way to explore the embedding space and relationships.
    *   **Techniques:** Use frameworks like Streamlit, Flask, or FastAPI with a frontend (React/Vue). Implement dimensionality reduction (t-SNE, UMAP) to project high-dimensional embeddings into 2D/3D for visualization. Allow users to click on points (chunks) to see their text and source.
*   **Graph-based Knowledge Representation (GraphRAG):**
    *   **Goal:** Build a dynamic knowledge graph from extracted concepts and their relationships.
    *   **Techniques:** Extract entities and relationships from text (e.g., using spaCy, NLTK, or smaller LLMs). Store these in a graph database (e.g., Neo4j, ArangoDB) and link them back to the embeddings in LanceDB. This enables complex queries like "Show me all concepts related to X that were discussed by Author Y in Document Z."
*   **AI-driven Synthesis & Summarization:**
    *   **Goal:** Automatically generate summaries or identify key connections across multiple documents.
    *   **Techniques:** Use larger LLMs to summarize clusters of related chunks or to answer complex questions by synthesizing information from multiple retrieved sources.
*   **Support for Learning Stages:**
    *   **Goal:** Design the interface to explicitly guide the user through Kolb's learning cycle (Concrete Experience, Reflective Observation, Abstract Conceptualization, Active Experimentation).
    *   **Techniques:** Features like "Reflect on this cluster," "Suggest related concepts for deeper understanding," "Propose an experiment based on these ideas."

This project has immense potential to become a powerful tool for knowledge workers and researchers. Good luck with your continued development!
